# AzureFunctionsExample

This is an Azure Functions Example using Docker. 

It is a weather API that retrieves temperature info of the City Id received in the URL. I use an APIKEY provided by OpenWeather.

To find the id of the desired city, check city.list.json.

## HTTP Trigger

The HTTP trigger lets you invoke a function with an HTTP request. 
You can use an HTTP trigger to build serverless APIs.
If you're using an apikey, you'll need to include that in your request.
